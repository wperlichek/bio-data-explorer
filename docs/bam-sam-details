## What are they

SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) files are fundamental formats in genomics that store information about how short sequencing reads align to a reference genome. Essentially, they record the precise genomic location where each tiny DNA fragment from your sample maps, serving as a crucial bridge between raw sequencing data and all downstream analyses like variant calling or gene expression. While SAM files are human-readable text, BAM files are their compressed, binary equivalents, designed for highly efficient storage and rapid processing (often accelerated by an accompanying index) of the massive datasets generated by modern sequencing technologies.

## Details

The SAM file's header section, marked by lines starting with `@`, contains essential metadata about the reference genome, tools, and samples, and while technically optional, it is practically required for functional use and compatibility with bioinformatics tools.
