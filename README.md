Bioinformatics involves a lot of Linux native command-line work. If you're on Windows, 
it's best to install WSL for full access to the native Linux env and tools. Ubuntu 
is the default distro for WSL and widely used.

1.  **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator.**
2.  Run: `wsl --install`
3.  Follow prompts to **create a Linux username and password.**
4.  **Restart** your computer.
